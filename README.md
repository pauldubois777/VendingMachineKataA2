# VendingMachineKataA2

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.20-4.

I wrote it to code the [Vending Machine Kata](https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata)

Live demo is [here](http://vend.coderforchrist.com/)

The initial services (non-gui) were all created using TDD (Test Driven Development). 

Because of time constraints, I went forward with the component (gui) development without using TDD.  I commented out the app.component.spec.ts code, and only coded each components spec file with the items needed to get them to compile during tests.  IE: Injecting services where needed.

Also, I upgraded the version of Angular CLI during the GUI phase, so some of the last components created have the current version of testing code.

When time allows, I hope to return to this project and code tests for the components, as well as refactor code where needed.

Have fun, and let me know of any problems you see, or improvements I can make.  Thanks!

## Final Design

This section will hold the final design that evolved during the writing of tests and code.  It will show what went wrong with the original design, as well as items that were improved along the way.

See the Design Phase section below for my initial design prior to coding.

## Design Phase

Before writing any code, I first outlined a high level design of the objects and how they will interact.  I also wrote some logic notes as I thought through various aspects.

As I have worked on the tests and code, I have not updated this section with things I needed to rework.  Rather, when the code is complete, I will add a new section that describes the final design, and the process of creation.

So here are my initial design objects and notes:

### Product Model
* Description
* Cost

### Coin Enumeration
* Penny, Nickle, Dime, Quarter

### Inventory object - Holds the inventory of products in the machine
* Array of products with qty available
* Method to Dispense prodct - descreases qty of product by 1
* Method to Get Qty Available (product)

### Bank object - Holds the money in the machine
* Method to check if bank can make change.
    * The maximum change ever needed will be 20 cents
    * At least 4 nickles then return true
    * else if at least 2 nickles and at least 1 dime return true
    * else if 1 nickle and at least 2 dimes return true
    * otherwise return false
* Balance - Array of coins with qty of each coin in machine
* Method to return a monetary value from the bank.  This removes the appropriate coins from the bank balance, and send them to the Return object.
* Method to add coins to the bank.  Increases the Balance array of coins appropriately. 

### Coin Return object - Represents the coin return area
* Balance - Array of coins with qty of each coin in the return area
* Method to increase coins gets an array of coins with qty of each coin
* Method to remove all sets balance array to empty

### Inserted Coins object - Represents coin insertion
* Coins Balance - Array of coins with qty of each coin that has been Inserted
* Value Balance - Observable that emits the value of the coins in the Coins Balance
* Method to Insert Coin - If invalid coin calls return object to place coin in return, otherwise increases Coins Balance array
* Method to Return All - Calls return object to place all of Coins Balance in return, and emptys Coins Balance
* Method to Purchase - Is called when user purchases product, gets the purchase price.  Calls Bank Object to add all coins that have been inserted.  Calls Bank object to have it return the excess money that was inserted above the purchase price.

### Product Buttons
* One button for each product in the Inventory Object
* Each button is wired to the Purchase Obect to intiaite purchase of itself

### Purchase Object
* Method to initiate the purchase.  
* If product qty avail is zero then calls Message Display object to display temp message "SOLD OUT"
* Get balance inserted from Inserted Coins object and compares to product cost.  
* If not enough, then calls Message Display object to display temp message "PRICE x.xx" where x.xx is the product price.  
* If enough, calls Inventory object to dispense product, and calls Message Display object to disply temp message "THANK YOU".

### Message Display Object
* Observes the Value Balance of the Inserted Coins object. (Or could make this a method and call it from Instered Coins object when appropriate)
* If not zero, then displays the balance.  
* If zero, checks the Bank Object to see if it can make change.  If it can, then display "INSERT COIN", otherwise display "EXACT CHANGE ONLY".
* Method to display temp messages - Save the current message. display the temp message text for 1 second, then restore the saved text. 

## TODO
* Possible Improvements
    * Allow methods that take a single coin to also accept an array of coins. (Where applicable)
    * Enhance Bank Service canMakeChange to get an optional array of coins.  Then use this to combine with banks coins to see if change can be made. 
      This would allow the user to insert more than the cost of a product and purchase it, even if the bank cannot make change with the coins it has.
      IE:  The bank has no nickles or dimes.  The user inserts 2 quarters, 2 dimes, and a nickle to buy a 75 cent item.  The item is SOLD OUT, so the user then
      tries to purchase a poduct that costs 50 cents.  It should allow this, knowing that change can be made because all of the inserted coins is sent to the bank, and then excess returned.
* See if getters and setters can be tested with Jasmine.  IE: Can we now use toHaveBeenCalledTimes() on a getter?
* Put coins into a class instead of usng an enum with helpers?
